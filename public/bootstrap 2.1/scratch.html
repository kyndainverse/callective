Exploratory testing is an approach to testing that allows you the freedom to learn about an application, improve your skills and enhance your tests in an intelligent way based on feedback from execution. If you want to benefit from the full value of exploratory testing you should be taking a conscious exploratory approach across your entire test strategy and not just some manual stuff you do around the edges.
